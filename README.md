~ DESCRIPTION ~
This is a hand eye coordination focused arcade game.

~ OBJECTIVE ~
The objective of the game is to hit the most amount of falling disks as accurately as possible with either the 'A', 'S' or 'D' key. Those keys are your detonators.

~ TIMER ~
There will be a time limit of 100 seconds. So make every second count!

~ SCORE ~
You will be rewarded various score points for each hit based off of timing and accuracy.

~ GRAVITY LEVEL
Your 'Gravity Level' determines how quickly the disks spawn and fall. As you hit disks, you will be rewarded skill rating points behind the scenes which contribute towards promoting your Gravity Level. If you miss disks or allow them to pass by then you will lose skill rating and possibly demote your Gravity Level. The highest gravity level is 10.

~ STREAK COUNT ~
You can grow a streak for hitting multiple disks in a row without missing.

~ SCORE MULTIPLIER ~
You have a score multiplier which can double, triple or even quadrople the amount of points you earn for each hit. The higher your streak count, more your multiplier grows with 'x4' being the max.

~ MISSING A DISK ~
If you happen to miss a disk or trigger an empty detonator then your streak count and score multiplier bonus will both reset. Build it back up to earn as many points as possible.

~ POWER BAR BONUS MODE ~
Hitting an accuracy rating of 'Perfect' or 'Super Perfect' grants you powerbar points for it's respective column up to 100 points. Once you hit the cap your power bar will start to shrink and will spawn special 'Bonus Disks'. Hitting a Bonus Disk grants you 300 points regardless of accuracy (That's triple the max of a regular disk). They do not grant power bar points.
